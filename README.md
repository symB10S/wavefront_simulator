# wavefront_simulator
A wavefront simulator for simulating wavefronts in a circuit context.
[refer to docs](https://wavefront-simulator.readthedocs.io/en/latest/)

Preview the `example.ipynb` here not Github to get a sneak peek!

## requirements

you will require a Python installation (3.9 was used here)

[download python](https://www.python.org/downloads/)

Jupyter notebook is required for interactive elements

> pip install jupyter

VScode is recommended, it has builtin notebook functionality

[download VScode](https://code.visualstudio.com/download)

[jupyter for VScode](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/datascience/jupyter-notebooks)

For the verification module to work it is also required that LTspice is installed and confiugred

[download LTspice](https://www.analog.com/en/design-center/design-tools-and-calculators/ltspice-simulator.html)



## quick install

Next download the contents of this repositry, and unzip:

ROOT<br />
├─── docs<br />
├─── example.ipynb<br />
├─── test.py<br />
├─── requirements.txt<br />
└─── wavefronts  <-- this is where modules are stored <br />

The ROOT level is where `test.py` and `example.ipynb` is.

Open a terminal at this folder.

install the requirements ([a venv is always good](https://realpython.com/python-virtual-environments-a-primer/)):

> pip install -r requirements.txt

Now run `test.py` or `examples.ipynb` in VScode.
